# Car Renting System 

![Golden Car Rental System]

## Project Description

This is a Java-based desktop application for managing a car rental system. It allows users to rent and return cars (including normal cars and buses), add new vehicles to the fleet, view available cars, and check transaction history within specified date ranges. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing.

## Features ✨

- **Car Management**: Add new normal cars and buses with details like:
  - Name, color, ID, chassis number
  - Regular renting price
  - Maximum allowed rentals
  - Specific attributes (max rent duration and discount for normal cars, capacity for buses)

- **Car Rental**: Rent available cars to clients, capturing:
  - Client details (name, SNN, phone number, address)

- **Car Return**: Mark rented cars as returned

- **View Available Cars**: Display a list of all cars in the fleet with availability status

- **Transaction History**: View rental transactions between specified dates

- **Data Persistence**: Car data is saved to and loaded from `Car.dat` file

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive Swing interface for easy navigation
